It's a common habit of mine in note-taking to drop articles. I understand that
in the long run, it saves very little time as dropping a "the" or "a" saves at most
3 characters while shortening something like South East Asian Trade Organization
to SEATO saves a more substantial 26 (impromptu adding). Nonetheless, I continue
to do it since it gives my notes a cursory, quick-witted tone I suppose.

My problem comes, though, when others think that because I dropped the articles
informally, I'm inherently bad at English.

Storytime:

So in 7th grade, of course I'm taking notes like this when somebody just peers
over my shoulder and says, "You know you need a 'the' here," to which I tell myself,
"Shoosh, kid."

The End.

It's probably an unfounded pet-peeve, but it irks me nonetheless.

In other news:
  - I made a chatroom [here](http://chatteringwith.me)
  - I unknowingly spent $0.51 on Amazon Route 53, and I want that money back (even though I spent it...)
  - AP Physics is a *drag* (haha): 75% of the class is asleep which is mildly annoying
  - Github Game Off is happening...so are college apps (deja vu?), science projects, math competitions, and gah.
  - I wanna re-write the front-end of this site, but I suck at JS and don't have time.

That's it folks!

If you happen to be an admissions officer who searched me up: Hi! Please let me go to university!

See y'all later.
