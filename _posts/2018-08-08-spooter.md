Fresh out of the Nerdy Nights Pong tutorial, I had vowed never to write any
assembly for the NES ever again.

As you can guess, that didn't happen.

## Background
While on vacation visiting my grandparents, I found out about a game jam called
Floppy Jam. The gimmick of the jam was that all entries must theoretically
fit on the 1.44MB alloted to a floppy disk, hence the name of the jam.
Naturally, this meant that most orthodox game engines would not meet the cut as they create too much overhead.

This also meant that I was down to only a few options if I chose to participate:
   1. Finally learn OpenGL and pray that I can write something in C/C++
   2. Hack a thing together with various JS libraries and a canvas
   3. Go back to NESASM hell

I might also mention at this point that my grandparents have limited access to
the Internet, and being on vacation, I wanted to see sights, not screens.
So, with a few cached NESDev wiki pages and the 6502 instruction manual in hand,
I jumped back into the fray of writing really bad assembly code.

## Process
For the longest time, I had dreamed of making an even shittier version of
Hong Kong 97, a bootleg SNES game starring Jackie Chan vs China. While this was
impetus for the project, Spooter very quickly morphed into a traditional space shooter.

One of the greatest hurdles in designing Spooter was controlling groups of objects
(lasers, aliens, explosions). Initially, I thought this could be done naively by
hardcoding the functionality of every object individually but ended up
activating and deactivating members of
certain groups with a bitmask (the value 00001001 would mean the 1st and 4th
members were active). Much of the project then ended up being loops through bitmasks
that would update the active members of various groups.

By far, the largest time sink with NESASM was fixing bugs. Often this was a slip-up
like forgetting to load newly-added sprites or writing to the wrong area of memory.
Other times, bugs were a result of inexperience with writing for the system such
as not knowing to turn off NMI before loading a new BG.

## What Remains
I had wanted to add music and sound-effects into the game but lack of experience
with the APU and time made this a hard endeavor. Another early dream was also to
parallel the boss of Hong Kong 97 with a large boss made of BG tiles. This was
also not possible due to lack of experience.

Regarding the remaining bugs and regrets in Spooter, the game over screen
flashes on updates as the background is getting updated which requires the screen to be
turned off for a very short, albeit noticeable, amount of time. The score also remains as an 8-bit value out of simplicity's sake and will overflow after the player
gets 256 points. The box art was also made by an MSPaint in the hour immediately
after the game's completion and leaves much to be desired.
