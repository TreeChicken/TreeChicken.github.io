This is a rare experience I would like to write up.

Recently, our school had the pleasure of hosting several exchange students from Osaka.
For three days, I was partnered up with a Japanese student 2 years my junior, call him T-san, which made for an interesting time.

The first difficulties came with actual communication. While I had taken Japanese for 4 years and my partner had done the same with English in Osaka,
both of us were not terribly confident in constructing sentences in each other's languages. For one, I came to realize that while I thought I had a reasonable
textbook understanding of the Japanese language, it was difficult to pull words and grammar on the fly in practice. I am not a native speaker and the struggle I had with
trying to communicate ideas in another language was a reminder of how much more I have to go with the language. Meanwhile, trying to understand my partner was also a challenge
in its own right. T-san's English was much more developed than my Japanese but still ended up fragmented when he tried to express more complicated ideas. Often, the greatest
challenge was figuring out the context of the fragments from my partner's point of view which.

Language difficulties aside, we also had some trouble finding common ground. In an age where the Internet has become sort of a glue that binds us all, I found it strange that
we still shared so many differences, even in the realm of digital culture which I had originally thought would not differ much. For one, it appears that many of the students
do not use Gmail which was crazy coming from an American kid who had grown up relying on Google's suite of services. It also appears that cellphone usage is not as liberal in
their school as it is in ours despite the large majority of the exchange students owning smartphones. Specifically regarding T-san, for the first 2 days, he was reluctant to
use his cellphone and only finally pulled it out when there was truly nothing for him to do. According to him, it seems like he risks getting his device confiscated if used
at an inappropriate time which, while not uncommon in American schools, seems to be declining due to schools becoming more open to cellphone usage. Looking at our interests, T-san
is significantly more active than me; he mentioned that he was on the tennis team and is a fan of the Orix Buffaloes. His academic interests also landed him closer to biology or history
while I have a harder time with those subjects, preferring to do computer work instead. Despite this, we did bond over Pokemon; both of us had played Gen 4 and Gen 5 games.
Knowing that sometime in the past, someone halfway across the world who lived in a completely different life than me could end up playing roughly the same video game that I did in
my youth is a little crazy.

A lot happened over these three days so here is a list of highlights / what I learned:
  - A host student was showing Google Earth off to his exchange student partner. He found her home which she affirmed by identifying her bike.
  - The word "meme" appears to mean nothing in Japanese
  - Vitamin C concentrations can be found via redox reaction and a starch indicator with iodine (TIL T-san...)
  - It seems the students are repreimanded if they forget their ties as part of their uniform. The fact that this was brought up makes me think it happened at least once...
  - Pizza is common in their area although the crust is thinner
  - T-san had consumed a total of 5 cookies throughout his time in the US
  - T-san showed me photos of when he visited a large torii gate
  - Line is more popular than Facebook in Japan
  - The large number of ezweb emails used by the exchange students was because they were linked to their cellphone
  - The exchange students are on spring vacation. They may also have a test after they come back...
  - I really suck at speaking Japanese
  - T-san gave me a name in kanji and folded it up into a crane

Joking aside, this was one of the most eye-opening experiences I have ever had. Although communication difficulties often had us sitting in awkward silence for most of the time,
for me, it's rare to be able to speak with a Japanese person let alone one close to my age and for more than a day. I cannot speak for T-san; I'm not sure what kind of person he
thinks I am or what he took away from this, but I really appreciate having him follow me around for 3 days and putting up with my patchwork Japanese. It was a great time and something
that has made me open my eyes and get a glimpse of the world, not just my country, as well as something that has driven me to try to improve upon my language skills.
