Yo.

School's out so it's summer time now. Wooo.

Doing an internship this year, so we'll see how that goes. It's on VR and we're trying
to run VR club at our school next year so that'll be fun.

In hindsight, a lot's happened so I'll just list some stuff (totally not a ruse to brush up on markdown syntax):

### What's happened since the last post:

* Finished taking tests. Scores come out July. Fingers crossed.
* Took a 5 mile urban hike for a McDonald's. Satisfied.
* Watched Mob Psycho 100. It was great. Highly reccommend.

### What's gonna happen this summmer:

* Internship. Researching VR.
* College apps.
* Writing an app. Networking portion is done. Hoping to finish UI and data parsing
* Trying to make a quizbowl site. It's going poorly.
* Wanna remake this site and host it on digital ocean.
* Joined sysops. Learning Django.
* Reading list:
	* Catch 22: 1/3 of the way done. Book is long.
	* The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: Murakami's writing is good. Sufficiently hooked.
	* Death with Interruptions: Summer reading. Book is good but tiresome.
	* The Trial: Barely started.
	* American Psycho: Also barely started.
	* Sherlock Holmes: Read out of order. Somewhere after the Sign of Four but before His Last Bow.
	* Handmaid's Tale: Falling asleep.
	* The Elephant Vanishes: Good but I got another Murakami to finish.
	* The Diamond Age: Decent but no time for.
