Welp, it's been a while.

We're approaching the final week of testing so that's good news.

I still need to find a job over the summer so there's that too...

It's been a really busy week, but I'm starting to find that sometimes, work never seems to payoff.
Maybe I'm just an idealist, but I tend to work under the principle that more work -> happier life.
However, the last seven days have been a tear-filled stress fest which makes me question why I even bother at some point.

And sometimes, you do put work in, but something or another screws you over.
I happened to be assigned a group for a presentation this week that's getting shown tomorrow.
For 2 days, I have forgone leisure time and self-studying to push this project off the ground and guess what happened tonight (cmon):

~60% of my slides: Deleted. Gone. Poof.

Apparently they weren't "related enough" to be a part of the presentation (most of which I made mind you :P).
And no objections to this either!
Group mates just decided it's perfectly fine to let me be the mule and pull heavy loads until they get the chance to swoop in, make an executive move, and call it a day.
This isn't the first time this has happened either. I find that this is commonplace in sports, game dev, and nearly any other team environment; Everyone thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong.

And hey really, I'm guilty of this too. Maybe it's just a human thing. Dunno but it ticks me off to be on the receiving end of that.

In any case, it's late. In the grand scheme of things, this is a small issue. I still learned a crap-ton from researching info for those slides which is what really matters to me.

See ya all in a week.

Gotta get a new theme too. Maybe I'l finally learn enough Ruby to git gud.
