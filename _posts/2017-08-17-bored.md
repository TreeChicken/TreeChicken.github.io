It's been a while friends.

Internship's slowed down. The first couple weeks were fun, we learned matrix math and shaders. However, once we got into data collection, it's just been a waiting
game. Not too bad though.

I've also been working (slowly) with a team on a first person point and click over at [Isolation](https://isolationstudios.github.io/). Check us out sometime!

As for books, still reading Death with Interruptions... Finished Wind-Up Bird; it was okay. Also read The Vegetarian by Han Kang. Strange book. Kinda don't like it.

College apps and research papers are up to bat next. Here's to hoping I can haul myself somewhere to pursue higher education.

Until then, cheers!
