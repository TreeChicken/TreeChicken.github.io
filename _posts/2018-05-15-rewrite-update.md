The blog has been rewritten (read as hacked together) from scratch to a resonable state. Pagination doesn't work
(mostly because I don't know what I'm doing :/) and I'm too lazy to put the emoji gem back in
but otherwise the site is as I want it. Of course, I still want to spiff it up a bit...maybe put
in an image carousel or something flashy. Some posts have been edited to fit with the new site
but nothing major so everything is moreorless preserved.

Actually, reading through the old posts, I get the feeling I was a whiny idiot back then... Maybe I'll look
back on this post too and think the same. For my own satisfaction, I could simply remove them but I like
to hoard stuff and y'all can find the old posts in the commit history anyways.

Regarding life:

It's been steady so far. Mostly been working on a pet project called Monsterboard. It's a mobile AR monster hunting
RPG that we just put up on the Amazon Appstore.
Check it out [here](https://www.amazon.com/Escapegoat-Monsterboard/dp/B07D1T3SBB/).

Also started Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online. Personally never watched the original SAO but starting
to like GGO a lot. The animation is solid and the music fits imo. LLENN is a bit OP which hopefully won't make
the fights stale, but I think she's got a good balance of wit and game time to explain her skill while Kirito
kinda was just overleveled :|. Hopefully the series keeps my interest!

Until next time. See ya then.
