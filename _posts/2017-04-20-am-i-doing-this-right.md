Github wasn't taking the console template so I found this one called Zetsu instead.
It's pretty neat although I'm new to this kind of stuff and thus have no idea where to credit who.

Finding a template's kinda been hell too. Console's problem was that for some reason, Github wouldn't take the localize gem even after I specified it as a plugin and rebundled.
After that, it was kind of a wild goose chase finding anything that worked. There was a really nice one, but I think it failed either because of emojis or Chinese characters.

That being said, I 've already spent way too much time on this again today. Need to study for chem. See ya.

TL;DR: New theme. Chem kills.

PS: Stop trying to click the social media links. They don't work (yet).
