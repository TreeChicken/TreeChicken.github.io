Hello. My name is Jason Maa.

I am a freshman CS major at UMD with an interest in machine learning and graphics.
In the past, among other things, I have worked a VR-related internship, created an OpenCV "filter",
and wrote code that programmatically parsed data from Protobowl, a quizbowl question site.

In my free time, I play a number of video games and try to learn more Japanese.
