![It's me.](/images/me.jpg)

Hello. My name is Jason Maa.

I am a rising college freshman CS major with a current interest in AI and graphics.
In the past, among other things, I have worked a VR-related internship at UMD, created an OpenCV "filter",
and wrote code that programmatically parsed data from Protobowl, a quizbowl question site.

Outside of academia, I'm a Japanophile and also play a good deal of video games.
